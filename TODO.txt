Implement a proper authentification like katana, with encryption and a way to identify the user
Implement data save per task for Create task / delete Task / update task (when defocusing the text field) / so that the LastUpdate date can be used more efficiently when updating only one entry
Move js code of the views (TaskList) into site.js
Move Business logic in Business Layer
Logging When appropriate (e.g. cache expiration or cache callback when elements are removed)
Making sure we are logging all exceptions on global and specific level and log accordingly
Test all the actions and test layers (BusinessLayer / CacheAccessLayer and controller) separately so tests are as unitary as possible / Mock cache : use Moq-like nuget packages
Checking that the cache is properly persisted when needed and that the data is cached, not from DB (basically have a finer control over what's cached and what's persisted and when). Maybe register transaction logs + snapshot DB to recover data if needed
